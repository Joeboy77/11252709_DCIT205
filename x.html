        <h2 class="what">What is CS+X?</h2>
        <p class="possi">The possibilities of multidisciplinary study are exploded by University of Ghana's Computer Science + X (CS+X) project. <br>Establishing links throughout the University and fostering transformative interactions between computer science and other subjects are our goals.</p><br>
        <p class="possi">Students and Lecturers are pushing the limits of computer science through CS+X, which has the potential to inspire whole new academic disciplines. Through courses relevant to non-majors, undergraduate students from many departments within the institution make the connection between computing and their academic interests. The goal of the PhD program in computer science at University of Ghana is to inspire students to work with advisers in computer science and other fields, as well as to explore wide research interests. Faculty in computer science form multidisciplinary research groups that span departments and schools and work with outside partners and businesses.</p>
